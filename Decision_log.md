- Access patterns for lists of documents:
    - use cursor based pagination instead of using offset based pagination
    - the set of documents shared with a user could change quickly, if we use offset based pagination and the set of documents shared with a user changes then the user might not see some documents at all or might see some documents multiple times when linearly traversing through the documents
        - traverse the index of a document on some indexed value like created at, use the document id as the tiebreaker for documents created at the same time
    - provide a useful was to search documents:
        - sorting:
            - support few different types of sorting because each field that we sort on has to als be a field that we index on. This is an implementation detail of cursor based pagination.
        - for documents that a user owns:
            - filters:
                - shared with a destination user by the current user
        - for documents that are shared with a user:
            - filters:
                - shared with the current user by a source user
        - regardless of ownership:
            - filters
                - last modified at
                - created at
            - queries:
                - text search
