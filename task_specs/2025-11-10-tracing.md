## Functional:
- I want to be able to see the path of a request through the application as it moves from the api gateway to one of the microservices or as it moves from the message proxy service to the operation event stream to the merge service and to other clients
- I want to be able to see traces after some amount of time that is not very long on human scales, less than 10 seconds
- I want to be able to query these traces using some information that is available to the calling code / client, like a request id

## Technical
- Infrastructure changes:
    - add the opentelemetry collector to the docker compose file
    - add the grafana tempo receiver to the docker compose file
    - add the grafana ui to the docker compose file
- code changes:
    - add tracing sdk to the user service
        - create a connection to the otel collector
    - add instrumentation packages to the user service
        - add the pgx instrumentation package
        - add the grpc instrumentation package
        - look to see if sqlc supports generating code with traces?
