## Description:
- implement these 5 permission crud routes:
    - [x] get all the permissions on a document
    - [x] create a permission on a document
        - this should work for both a guest or a user
    - [x] get the permissions of a principal on a document 
    - [x] update the permissions of a principal on a document
        - this should work for both a guest or a user 
    - [x] delete the permissions of a principal on a document
        - this should work for both a guest or a user
- coarse grain authorization checks
    - [x] only users can create permissions
        - the document service will verify that the specific user has an owner permission on the document, allowing them to create more permissions
    - [x] only users can get all the permissions on a document 
        - the document service will verify that the specific user has owner permission on that document, allowing them to view other users permission
    - [xs] only users can update a specific permission
    - [x] only users can delete a specific permission
- [ ] give the routes another once over to make sure that the correct things are marked as required
    - [x] request bodies
    - [x] parameters in request bodies
    - [ ] parameters in response bodies
    - [x] parameters in the query
- [x] validate that routes perform JWT parsing and coarse grain authorization checking of the user type before we deserialize the request body
