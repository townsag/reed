## Functional:
- Operators should be able to find application level logs that have been collated with traces
    - from grafana loki viewer operators should be able to access logs stored in grafana loki

## Technical:
- introduce the logging otel sdk and api
- create a default slog logger that is backed by the otel logging handler
- push logs to the otel collector using grpc
- otel collector exports logs to grafana loki
- configure grafana loki and grafana tempo to recognize the collated traces and logs
- at the service level log business logic related things
    - also log failures related to calls to the repository level
- at the server level log network, authentication, ser / des, etc related things
